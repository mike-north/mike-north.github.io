        <h5>Write once, run everywhere: ambitious cross-device web apps</h5>
        <p>Ember.js is an opinionated web framework, that allows developers to focus less on boilerplate, and focus more on what makes their app unique. We'll go over some of the best practices of using Ember for cross-device development, and then build an app from a single codebase that produces a standalone desktop app, an in-browser web app and an iOS/Android app.</p>
        <p>Along the way, we'll cover
          <ul>
            <li>A high level overview of the Ember.js ecosystem, including build tools and "add-ons"</li>
            <li>Recent improvements to Ember's view layer, and the ramifications on mobile performance</li>
            <li>Best practices for tooling & build pipelines, to maintain your cross-device compatibility</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
